## Project Proposal
This project involves creating a quiz app which can be used by new joiners in the Commercial Data Science team. The quiz will require participants to use SQL to query Commercial data in order retreive the answers to the questions. This projects aims to solve the issue of upskilling new joiners as soon as possible by getting them familiar with the most common tables used within the Commercial team. The proposed app should present a series of questions and provide multiple choice answers for the user to pick. Once submitted, the app should present their score, as well as provide feedback on questions they got wrong. Javascript will be used due to it's ability to run directly in the browser, without needing additional web server setup, which would be required in Python. Furthermore, Javascript can provide a rich dynamic and interactive interface, which would be useful in future iterations of the app. HTML will be used to create the structure for the app and CSS will be used to enhance the design element.
