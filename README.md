## Project Planning
To complete this project, I used Agile principles in conjunction with the Scrum framework. One of the main Agile principles I used was prioritising working software rather than focusing on a long documentation process. Part of this includes documenting code within the code, rather than creating a separate document as this takes up a lot of time and can be less effective than using comments within code. I used the Scrum framework to break down the project into several iterations, completing small milestones using sprints, rather than attempting to create the final product from the beginning. This comes with the advantage of being able to create MVPs to gain feedback which can be used to consistently improve the app. Furthermore, this allows a product to be pushed to live faster, with improvements being added post-deployment.
As mentioned earlier, the project was broken down into a series sprints - each with a particular goal to progress the application. The sprint and sprint goals were as follows:
Sprint 1: Project Planning

## Project Proposal
This project involves creating a quiz app which will be used by new joiners in the Commercial Data Science team. The quiz will require participants to use SQL to query Commercial data in order to retrieve the answers to the questions. This project aims to solve the issue of upskilling new joiners as soon as possible by getting them familiar with the most common tables used within the Commercial team. The proposed app should present a series of questions and provide multiple-choice answers for the user to pick. Once submitted, the app should present their score, as well as provide feedback on questions they got wrong. Javascript will be used due to its ability to run directly in the browser, without needing additional web server setup, which would be required in Python. Furthermore, Javascript can provide a dynamic and interactive interface, which would be useful in future iterations of the app. HTML will be used to create the structure for the app and CSS will be used to enhance the design element.
