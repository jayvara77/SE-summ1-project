## About the App
This app is a short quiz which allows new Data Science Commercial team joiners to take in order to test their current knowledge and help them get a better understanding of data tables used in the commercial team. It consists of 5 multiple-choice questions, each of which will require the user to query certain tables to get the correct answer. Upon completing the quiz, the user will receive feedback on their submission. The user will be notified of their score as well as feedback on any questions they got wrong alongside the correct answer and hints on which tables to use to get the correct answer. The user will then be able to retake the quiz by clicking on the "retake quiz" button.

## User Documentation
To run the quiz, simply click on the link above which will take you to the quiz! Read the quiz introduction which will give you tell you which tables would be useful and then simply answer all the questions to the best of your ability. Once you have picked your answers, click submit and you will get your results. Upon getting your results, you can retake the quiz in case you didn't get full marks and can use the table hint to help you answer the question. If any bugs are found, please email jay.vara@ba.com along with the issues you are facing.

## Technical Documentation


## Project Planning
To complete this project, I used Agile principles in conjunction with the Scrum framework. One of the main Agile principles I used was prioritising working software rather than focusing on a long documentation process. Part of this includes documenting code within the code, rather than creating a separate document as this takes up a lot of time and can be less effective than using comments within code. I used the Scrum framework to break down the project into several iterations, completing small milestones using sprints, rather than attempting to create the final product from the beginning. This comes with the advantage of being able to create MVPs to gain feedback which can be used to consistently improve the app. Furthermore, this allows a product to be pushed to live faster, with improvements being added post-deployment.
As mentioned earlier, the project was broken down into a series sprints - each with a particular goal to progress the application. The sprint and sprint goals were as follows:
Sprint 1: Project Planning
Sprint goal: Create a project proposal and both prototypes of the app.

Sprint 2: MVP
Sprint goal: Create the first MVP of the app with basic html and css, as well as basic functionality with a small subset of questions. Basic features included a retake button, results section and the ability to submit answers and get the results.

Sprint 3: V1 App
Sprint goal: Add the first two questions to the app and add a quiz introduction and information. This created a basic app that was functional and relevant to BA Commercial team, although no styling was implements and not all the questions were added.

Sprint 4: V1.2 App
Sprint goal: Fixed a bug which allowed for submission without picking options. Also, added all the questions and changed the font to match the BA style.

Sprint 5: V1.3 App
Sprint goal: Add the colour scheme and styling, as well as tweaking the code to get it into functions format. Also added additional feedback for the user to provide a hint as to which table to get the answers from. Finally, added a testing module using jest so that the functions can be tested.



## Project Proposal
This project involves creating a quiz app which will be used by new joiners in the Commercial Data Science team. The quiz will require participants to use SQL to query Commercial data in order to retrieve the answers to the questions. This project aims to solve the issue of upskilling new joiners as soon as possible by getting them familiar with the most common tables used within the Commercial team. The proposed app should present a series of questions and provide multiple-choice answers for the user to pick. Once submitted, the app should present their score, as well as provide feedback on questions they got wrong. Javascript will be used due to its ability to run directly in the browser, without needing additional web server setup, which would be required in Python. Furthermore, Javascript can provide a dynamic and interactive interface, which would be useful in future iterations of the app. HTML will be used to create the structure for the app and CSS will be used to enhance the design element.
